# This is an annotated GuildPkg. Review the comments and default
# values below and modify or remove as needed.

[package]

# The package section defines the package attributes. You must at a
# minimum specify name, version, and at least one source.

  name = NAME
  version = VERSION
  source = SOURCE-1 SOURCE-2

# By default, each source is copied to the package unmodified. If the
# package requires a built step or any changes to source, you must use
# a packager, which is listed below. See the default packager script
# for details. If the package is simply a repackaging of the sources,
# delete the packager attribute and the packager script.

  packager = packager
